# Super Duper Boss Fight V1 (SmallBasic)

Another video game made using the graphical capabilities of Microsoft SmallBasic in which the player is a tank and must shoot and defeat an enemy without getting hit.

## How to Run
For this program to run, it is highly recommended that it is run using Microsoft SmallBasic as it is unknown how it will run otherwise. Optimization was accounted for to some extent but the game has not been tested on other devices, meaning fluency and stability are not a guarantee.

## Gameplay

The player controls a tank which is moved using WASD, can aim by pointing the mouse cursor, and can fire when holding down the mouse button. This time around, the only playable segment of the game is a scripted, introductory sequence where the player must either dodge or destroy incoming asteroids. The player's shots are not created entities and are instead registered instantly as though they were a real bullet. The player has 5 points of health and is given recovery time after a hit. There is a cinematic death sequence with the option to retry which does not work.
  
All graphical assets used for this game were made from scratch in Microsoft Paint.

### Issues

The speed of the game is likely determined by the processing power of the device it is run on though this has not been tested. Overall, the game is largely unfinished and exists as a demo more than a full game experience.
